README: perl-depends - Roughly find out module depends from a Perl file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Find out roughly the modules the program uses. This is based on the
idea, that Perl evaluates the "use" commands at compile time and
stores the loaded module information into the %INC variable. By
examining the loaded modules and comparing them against the standard
Perl modules, the external module dependencies can be roughly
estimated.

The source package directories:

    bin/            The program and system manual page (*.1)
    doc/            Documentation
